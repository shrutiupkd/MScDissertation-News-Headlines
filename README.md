Visualisation of COVID-19 Vaccine Data and News Headlines. The project integrates vaccination data with sentiment analysis, offering an interactive dashboard built using Python's Dash framework.

Description:
This project investigates the impact of media coverage on public sentiment toward COVID-19 vaccinations in the UK. By analysing over 433,000 headlines from major newspapers like The Guardian, Daily Mail, and Evening Standard, it identifies patterns in sentiment that influence public perception.
