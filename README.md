# MScDissertation-News-Headlines
Visualisation of COVID-19 Vaccine Data and News Headlines. The project integrates vaccination data with sentiment analysis, offering an interactive dashboard built using Python's Dash framework.

Description:
This project investigates the impact of media coverage on public sentiment toward COVID-19 vaccinations in the UK. By analysing over 433,000 headlines from major newspapers like The Guardian, Daily Mail, and Evening Standard, it identifies patterns in sentiment that influence public perception.

The project integrates vaccination data with sentiment analysis, offering an interactive dashboard built using Python's Dash framework. The dashboard visualises sentiment trends, keyword frequencies, and their correlation with vaccination rates across different demographic and regional segments in the UK.

Key Features:

Data Collection: Utilised web scraping tools to gather headlines from major UK news sources.
Sentiment Analysis: Applied VADER for sentiment classification (Positive, Neutral, Negative).
Interactive Dashboard: Visualises trends using bar charts, line graphs, and word clouds for an intuitive user experience.
Insights: Explores how media sentiment influenced vaccine hesitancy and acceptance over time.
Technologies Used:

Python (Dash, Plotly, Pandas, NLTK, BeautifulSoup)
Data Sources: News websites (The Guardian, Daily Mail, Evening Standard) and National Vaccination Data
Sentiment Analysis: VADER for lightweight, high-performance sentiment scoring
Potential Applications:

Public health strategy development
